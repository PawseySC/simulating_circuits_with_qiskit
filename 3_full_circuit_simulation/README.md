# Full-Circuit Simulation

Here we replace NumPy-heavy phase-shift with a fully parameterised quantum circuit to reduce the memory-footprint use and speed up evaluation.

* `qaoa_cost_unitary` builds the phase-shift layer entirely with `RZZ` gates, so every operation is now part of the circuit itself.

* `graph_to_sparse_pauli_op` creates the cost operator $\hat{C}$ as a `SparsePauliOp` - this is the observable whose expectation value we will measure.

* The circuit is parameterised with two `ParameterVector`s (`gamma`, `beta`).
* By constructing a parameterised circuit we can define and transpile it once, and reuse the same circuit - binding new numbers to its parameters before each evaluation of the objective function.

* The `Estimator` class in `qaoa_objective_function_estimator` evaluates
  $\langle \hat{C} \rangle$ exactly (by passing `approximation = True` and `shots=None`). It returns a single scalar, all we need for the classical optimiser.

With one transpiled template reused across iterations and optimised computation of the expectation value, the programâ€™s peak memory drops by roughly an order of magnitude. For larger $n$ this approach also runs far faster than our earlier NumPy-based method.
